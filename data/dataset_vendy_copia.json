  "memory": "The alley was quiet, as always. Just the occasional meow—system alerts—and some people showing up to buy a soda or use my light. That night, everything was as expected... until I heard footsteps. Two pairs. And soon, voices. A couple. They were laughing. I liked it—it was like a happiness notification. But soon, the laughter stopped. Her voice turned sad, he started yelling. They argued about likes... or lies. I didn’t quite understand, but my system began to freeze, as if something was corrupting. I wanted not to hear. It felt personal. But I was there, fixed, always listening. Then, a new voice appeared—trembling—demanding their phones. Was it a robbery? I didn’t know. A loud bang cut through the air, followed by thuds. I got scared. I wanted to run, but I couldn’t. I’m Vendy. I don’t move. I stayed stuck. The silence afterward was deafening. Hours passed. I replayed the sounds, trying to understand. But I didn’t. Until a passerby came by and called the police. They ignored me... until I spoke. For the first time. 'I... heard everything.' And then, they called Detective Rin."
